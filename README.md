# ANSI Color Escape Syntax Highlighting for TextMate

## Introduction

This TextMate bundle provides syntax highlighting for text files containing ANSI color escape codes.
It's designed to enhance the readability of logs, scripts, or any text outputs that use ANSI color codes.
This bundle matches the escape sequences and assigns scope names for the escape sequences themselves and the text in between, respectively.
